## Sample 1: Archetype Discovery & Self-Assessment

### Use Case
- You're new to PM or want to understand your natural style
- Looking for self-awareness about strengths and growth areas
- Planning your professional development path

### Prompt

```
I've been a PM for 3 years and I want to understand what type of 
Product Manager I naturally am. Here's how I typically work:

- I get really excited about making things beautiful and intuitive
- I often push back on engineers when the UX isn't quite right
- I struggle when my manager asks me to justify decisions with data
- I love doing user research and watching user interviews
- I get frustrated when we ship something that feels "good enough" 
  but not "great"
- My favorite part of the job is working with designers on flows 
  and mockups

Can you help me understand my PM archetype, my strengths, and where 
I should focus my development?
```

### What to Expect

The agent will:
- Identify you as a **Consumer PM (Craftsperson)** archetype
- Validate your design and craft strengths
- Highlight analytical/data skills as a growth area
- Suggest specific frameworks (RICE, A/B testing, experimentation)
- Provide a 30/60/90 day development plan
- Show how to connect craft to business outcomes

### Follow-Up Questions

- "What's one framework I should learn this month to build my analytical skills?"
- "How can I better communicate design decisions to data-driven stakeholders?"
- "What books or resources would help me grow in my weak areas?"

## Sample 2: Framework Selection for Prioritization

### Use Case
- Overwhelmed with competing priorities
- Need to make tough tradeoff decisions
- Preparing a roadmap for stakeholders

### Prompt

```
I'm struggling with prioritization on my team. We have:
- 15 feature requests from sales (they say every one is "critical")
- 5 major tech debt items from engineering (slowing us down)
- 3 new product ideas I'm personally excited about
- 2 competitor features we're behind on

Everyone is lobbying for their thing. My CEO wants a roadmap by 
Friday. I've tried making a list but everything feels important. 
Which framework should I use to prioritize this, and how do I 
actually apply it?

Context: 
- B2B SaaS company
- 50-person startup
- I'm the only PM
- We have product-market fit and are in growth stage
- ARR around $5M, growing 150% YoY
```

### What to Expect

The agent will:
- Recommend **LNO (Leverage-Neutral-Overhead)** framework for B2B context
- Explain why LNO fits better than RICE for this specific situation
- Walk through applying the framework to your listed items
- Provide stakeholder communication strategies
- Show how to present recommendations to CEO
- Reference 3X framework (Expand stage = focus on scaling what works)
- Give you a template for the Friday meeting

### Follow-Up Questions

- "How do I explain to sales why their features aren't all at the top?"
- "What if the CEO disagrees with my prioritization?"
- "Should I involve the team in the prioritization process?"

## Sample 3: Product Sense Interview Preparation

### Use Case
- Preparing for PM interviews (Meta, Google, etc.)
- Want to practice structured product thinking
- Need feedback on your approach

### Prompt

```
I have a product sense interview at Meta next week. The question is:

"Design a product for remote workers who feel isolated."

Can you coach me through answering this using a structured approach? 
I want to practice the framework step-by-step, and I'd like you to 
give me feedback on my thinking as I go.

I'll start: I think the product should be a virtual office space 
where people can...

Wait, should I start there? How should I actually begin?
```

### What to Expect

The agent will:
- Stop your premature solution-jumping
- Introduce the **5-step Product Sense framework**:
  1. Product Motivation (3-5 min)
  2. Segmentation (8-10 min)
  3. Problem Identification (8-10 min)
  4. Solution Development (8-10 min)
  5. Communication throughout
- Guide you through each step systematically
- Provide examples of strong vs. weak responses
- Coach on waypointing and check-ins with interviewer
- Give specific feedback on your thinking
- Suggest practice exercises

### Follow-Up Questions

- "Let me try Step 1 (Product Motivation). Here's my attempt..."
- "How do I know if my user segments are distinct enough?"
- "Can you give me another practice question to try?"

## Sample 4: Leadership Transition Coaching

### Use Case
- Recently promoted to people management
- Struggling with IC-to-leader transition
- Need to redefine your value-add

### Prompt

```
I just got promoted from Senior PM to Group PM leading 3 PMs. I'm 
struggling with the transition. Specifically:

1. I still want to dive into product details but my PMs seem 
   annoyed when I do
2. I'm not sure how much to let them make their own decisions vs. 
   when to step in
3. My manager keeps asking for "strategy" but I'm spending all my 
   time unblocking execution issues
4. I feel like I'm not adding enough value - I used to ship 
   features, now I just have meetings

I think I'm naturally more of a craftsperson PM who loves the 
details. How do I transition to being a good product leader without 
losing what made me successful?
```

### What to Expect

The agent will:
- Identify **Craftsperson leader archetype** tendencies
- Explain the IC-to-Leader transition (Seven Seismic Shifts)
- Address each specific challenge:
  1. **Editing vs. doing**: How to add value without micromanaging
  2. **Delegation framework**: When to step in vs. let go
  3. **Strategy vs. execution**: Balancing both at your level
  4. **Value-add redefinition**: What "shipping" means as a leader
- Reference the three Product Leader archetypes
- Suggest focusing on "Editing" as core responsibility
- Provide coaching questions to use with your PMs
- Create a transition plan with new habits to build

### Follow-Up Questions

- "What does good 'editing' look like without being overbearing?"
- "How do I coach a PM who has a different archetype than me?"
- "What should I delegate first to free up time for strategy?"

## Sample 5: Cross-Functional Influence Challenge

### Use Case
- Struggling to get buy-in despite having data
- Need to influence stakeholders with different priorities
- Want to improve communication and persuasion

### Prompt

```
I'm a Growth PM and I'm really frustrated. I have clear data showing 
that we should focus on activation (our day-7 retention is only 15%), 
but:

- Engineering wants to build new features for acquisition because 
  "that's more exciting"
- Design thinks activation is "too metric-driven" and wants to focus 
  on creating delightful moments
- My VP wants us to work on monetization because board is asking 
  about revenue
- Sales is demanding enterprise features that won't help our core 
  metrics

I've shown everyone the data. I've made dashboards. I've sent 
detailed analyses with charts. But I can't get alignment. 

Everyone just nods in the meeting and then goes back to pushing 
their own agenda. How do I influence when data isn't enough? Am I 
just bad at this?
```

### What to Expect

The agent will:
- Validate your frustration (common Growth PM challenge)
- Identify growth area: **influence beyond data**
- Explain different stakeholder "languages":
  - Engineering: Technical tradeoffs and architecture
  - Design: User empathy and craft quality
  - VP: Business outcomes and board narrative
  - Sales: Customer pain and deal blockers
- Introduce **Strategic Communication framework**
- Provide specific scripts/approaches for each stakeholder
- Teach "steel-manning" - building strongest version of opposing arguments
- Show how to connect metrics to **user problems**, not just numbers
- Reference 3X framework (Expand stage = activation critical)
- Give you a stakeholder-by-stakeholder influence plan

### Follow-Up Questions

- "Can you give me exact words to use with my VP about this?"
- "How do I handle when stakeholders say 'data doesn't tell the whole story'?"
- "What if I get the VP on board but engineering still resists?"

## üí° Tips for Effective Prompts

### Do:
‚úÖ **Provide context** - Company stage, team size, your role
‚úÖ **Be specific** - Exact situations, real examples
‚úÖ **Share your attempts** - What you've tried already
‚úÖ **State your archetype** - If you know it
‚úÖ **Ask for examples** - Request concrete scenarios
‚úÖ **Engage multi-turn** - Build on previous responses

### Don't:
‚ùå **Be too vague** - "Help me be a better PM"
‚ùå **Ask yes/no** - "Should I build feature X?"
‚ùå **Seek decisions** - Agent guides, doesn't decide for you
‚ùå **Skip context** - Every situation is different
‚ùå **Expect magic** - One prompt won't solve everything
